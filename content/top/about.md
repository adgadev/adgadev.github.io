I'm a software engineer with more than 12 years of experience building enterprise applications across multiple industries. 
My main field of expertise is backend development, primarily using Java and its ecosystem like Spring / Hibernate / JEE. 
Enthusiast of Spring / Spring Boot technology stack, microservices, Domain Driven Design and clean code principles.

I'm passionate about all aspects of software engineering, looks for pure and possibly new solutions and eager to learn.
I strongly believe that good code has to be elegant and nice to look at, clean and self-describing.
